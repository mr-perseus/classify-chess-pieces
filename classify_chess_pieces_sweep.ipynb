    "# 🧹 Introduction to Hyperparameter Sweeps using W&B\n",
    "\n",
    "Searching through high dimensional hyperparameter spaces to find the most performant model can get unwieldy very fast. Hyperparameter sweeps provide an organized and efficient way to conduct a battle royale of models and pick the most accurate model. They enable this by automatically searching through combinations of hyperparameter values (e.g. learning rate, batch size, number of hidden layers, optimizer type) to find the most optimal values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we'll see how you can run sophisticated hyperparameter sweeps in 3 easy steps using Weights and Biases.\n",

    "## Sweeps: An Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Running a hyperparameter sweep with Weights & Biases is very easy. There are just 3 simple steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the sweep:** we do this by creating a dictionary or a [YAML file](https://docs.wandb.com/library/sweeps/configuration) that specifies the parameters to search through, the search strategy, the optimization metric et all.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initialize the sweep:** with one line of code we initialize the sweep and pass in the dictionary of sweep configurations:\n",
    "`sweep_id = wandb.sweep(sweep_config)`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Run the sweep agent:** also accomplished with one line of code, we call `wandb.agent()` and pass the `sweep_id` to run, along with a function that defines your model architecture and trains it:\n",
    "`wandb.agent(sweep_id, function=train)`\n",
    "\n",
    "And voila! That's all there is to running a hyperparameter sweep! In the notebook below, we'll walk through these 3 steps in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We highly encourage you to fork this notebook so you can tweak the parameters,\n",
    "try out different models,\n",
    "or try a Sweep with your own dataset!\n",
